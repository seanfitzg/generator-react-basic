> Very basic React project with Browseriify, Babel and Gulp

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-react-basic using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-react-basic
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
mkdir project-name
cd project-name
yo react-basic
```
Then run the project:

```bash
gulp
```

Put your jsx into the src\app.jsx file.  Any changes are watched, resulting in a compile, bundle and page refresh.  Simple.
